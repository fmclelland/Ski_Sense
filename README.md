# Ski_Sense
This repository contains the supporting data and code for the article "Ski Sense, a Method of Classifying Snow Types".
The main concepts used in the code can be used as an example for data analysis techniques including:
- Extracting frequency content from real world signals.
- Extracting dominant structures from a large data set using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- Solving the transfer function of a data driven model using Convex Optimization and minimizing total variation.
- Solving for the rigid body dynamics of a simple system.
- Parameter reduction using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).
